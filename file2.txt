Hello all, my name is Mihika and this is my DSA project. I have tried implementing splay trees for data encoding.
I have used heap for created a tree with the help of Min Heap.
This is the file to be encoded. Splay trees are not strictly balanced trees, but they are roughly balanced trees.
To search any element in the splay tree, first, we will perform the standard binary search tree operation.
